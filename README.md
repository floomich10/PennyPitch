# PennyPitch

The Penny Pitch game is popular in amusement parks. Pennies are tossed onto a board that has certain areas marked with different prizes. For example:

The prizes available on this board are puzzle, game, ball, poster, and doll. At the end of the game, if all of the squares that say BALL are covered 
by a penny, the player gets the ball. This is also true for the other prizes. The board is made up of 25 squares (5 x 5). Each prize appears on three
randomly chosen squares so that 15 squares contain prizes. Create a PennyPitch application that displays a Penny Pitch board (use [and] to indicate squares) 
with prizes randomly placed and then simulates ten pennies being randomly pitched onto the board. After the pennies have been pitched, the application should 
display a message indicating which prizes have been won, if any.
